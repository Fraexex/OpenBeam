# Beamforming Research & Implementation Project

## Current Status
**IN PROGRESS**

## Project Overview

This project aims to make **beamforming research and implementation more accessible** by developing both simulation and hardware solutions. The team will work on **FDTD-based simulations** and **hardware development of a beamformer**, starting with phased array elements.

## Educational Value Added

This project provides hands-on experience in **RF system design, embedded systems development, phased array technology, and FDTD simulations**. It bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment, preparing engineers for real-world applications in wireless communication and radar systems.

## Tasks

### **Simulation Engineer**
Your job is to develop **FDTD (Finite-Difference Time-Domain) simulations** for beamformers of different shapes and configurations. You will:
- Implement an FDTD-based simulation framework.
- Optimize algorithms for **high accuracy and efficiency**.
- Work with the hardware team to **validate** simulations against real-world results.
- Provide visualizations and reports on simulated beam patterns.

### **Embedded Engineers**
Your role is to develop the **firmware for the Raspberry Pi Pico** to control the beamformer. You will:
- Implement SPI/I2C communication to interface with:
  - **MAX2822** for up/down-converting RF signals.
  - **MAX5864** for ADC/DAC conversion.
- Develop software to **synchronize** signals across phased array elements.
- Ensure **real-time data handling** and signal processing.
- Work closely with the **RF and PCB teams** to integrate the firmware with the hardware.

### **RF Circuit Designers**
You are responsible for designing the **RF circuitry** for the beamformer. Your tasks include:
- Designing and developing **phased array antenna elements**.
- Creating an **RF signal chain** using MAX2822 and MAX5864.
- Ensuring proper **impedance matching** for minimal signal loss.
- Collaborating with the **PCB team** to design RF layouts.

### **PCB Designers**
Your job is to design the **beamformer motherboard** that integrates all components. You will:
- Create a PCB that connects **MAX2822, MAX5864, and the Raspberry Pi Pico**.
- Optimize signal routing to **minimize interference and losses**.
- Prepare **Gerber files** and oversee the PCB manufacturing process.
- Work closely with **RF engineers** to ensure proper grounding and RF isolation.

## Design Decisions

- Engineers should document design choices, including **trade-offs** and **justifications** for component selection.
- The **simulation team** will provide feedback to optimize antenna element placement.
- PCB layouts must be reviewed by both **RF and embedded engineers** before fabrication.

## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process

1. Keep a **running log** of design iterations.
2. Provide **diagrams and schematics** where applicable.
3. Submit updates to the repository with **detailed commit messages**.
4. Write **clear documentation** for any custom software or hardware decisions.

## BOM + Component Cost

A bill of materials (BOM) will be maintained to track all **components and costs**. Each engineer should update the BOM when selecting or modifying components.
